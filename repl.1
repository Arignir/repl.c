.Sh SYNPOSIS
.Nm repl
.Ar command

.Sh DESCRIPTION
When invoked, the
.Nm repl
utility puts the user in a read-eval-print loop, in which it reads
input from the user, appends it to the
.Ar command
provided by the single argument, and lets the shell evaluate the
full string.

Built on GNU readline, it supports history and Emacs key bindings.

.Nm repl
is useful for command-line interfaces built on a 
.Dq prefix command
that has to be typed over and over preceding the actual command, like
.Xr git 1 .
